# OpenTTD-TinyPatches

## OpenTTD-WASD Patch v0.2
For my HHKB2, I want to play OpenTTD using wasd keys instead of arrow keys 
So, I made a WASD patch.

### Usage
Just apply this patch & compile & execute :P
**Also, you need to modify hotkeys.cfg** (Delete usage of wasd keys likes GLOBAL+A)

### Tested on 
* macOS Sierra (maybe availabe on Windows, Linux, etc....)

### TODO
* <s>Make a option menu for wasd feature enable/disable.</s>
* Auto disable hotkeys using wasd keys.
* Configureable keymaps for scrolling mainview. (But need to renaming wasd patch to other :P)
* Code refactoring :)

### Usage
Just apply this patch & compile & execute :P

### Tested on 
* macOS Sierra (maybe availabe on Windows, Linux, etc....)

### TODO
* Make a option menu for wasd feature enable/disable.
* Make ownership of tram roads.
